# 🔋 SmartGridAI — Weather-Aware Urban Energy Load Forecasting

SmartGridAI is a software-based web application that uses weather data and machine learning to predict urban electricity demand. Built to promote sustainable energy usage, it empowers users and urban planners with actionable insights aligned with UN SDG #7 (Affordable and Clean Energy).

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **AI-Driven Policy Engine** – Converts forecast data into actionable energy insights for city planners.
* 📈 **Weather-Aware Load Forecasting** – Predicts energy demand based on temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.
* 🔐 **Role-Based Access with Clerk** – Secure multi-user authentication and access control for analysts, admins, and general users.
* 🌍 **Sustainability Insights** – Estimates carbon footprint reduction from optimized energy usage.
* 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** – View city-wise load predictions, daily/hourly trends, and (optional) heatmap visualizations.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech Used |
|-------|-----------|
| ML Model | Python, Jupyter Notebook (Trained on historical + weather data) |
| ML API | Flask (serving predictions via REST API) |
| Backend | Node.js (handles API routing, OpenWeather integration) |
| Frontend | React.js (with Clerk for authentication) |
| Visualization | Chart.js (for graphs and heatmap) |
| Hosting | Vercel (Frontend), Railway/Render (Backend & Flask service) |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. User selects a city and date range via React frontend.
2. Backend (Node.js) fetches weather forecast from OpenWeatherMap API.
3. Flask ML microservice predicts energy demand based on weather and historical patterns.
4. Results are displayed as graphs, heatmaps, and sustainability tips.

## 📊 Sample Inputs

* City: Mumbai
* Date Range: 2025-04-11 to 2025-04-13
* Weather: 34°C, 70% humidity
* Output: Predicted load in MW with CO₂ impact estimate

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smartgrid-ai.git
   cd smartgrid-ai
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd client && npm install # React
   cd ../server && npm install # Node backend
   cd ../ml-service && pip install -r requirements.txt # Flask service
   ```

3. Start services
   ```bash
   # In separate terminals
   cd client && npm start
   cd server && node index.js
   cd ml-service && python app.py
   ```

4. Create a Clerk project and add your frontend URL for authentication

5. Add OpenWeatherMap API key in your backend as an environment variable:
   ```ini
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

* Real-time data integration from smart meters
* Geo-visual heatmaps with Leaflet.js
* Admin analytics dashboard
* Auto-policy recommendations for peak hours

## 🌱 Impact

By making urban energy load patterns predictable and visible, SmartGridAI empowers both individuals and city planners to:
* Reduce peak-hour electricity consumption
* Optimize energy infrastructure usage
* Lower carbon emissions
* Advance clean energy goals
